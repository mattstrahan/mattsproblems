## Welcome to Matt's Maths Problems

Matt's Maths Problems will generate endless questions for you, with a new problem every time.

If you're a student, you can practice maths questions, do tests, and learn more maths. The best way to get better is through practice, so give it a go!

If you're a teacher, you can build new exercises and generate worksheets for your students. The worksheets will be completely new every time, so you can spend time teaching rather than making up more questions.

Matt's Maths Problems is completely free to use for everyone. If you would like to help out by making new problems, exercises, or courses, go to the [Github Wiki](https://github.com/mattstrahan/mattsproblems/wiki/)!
