### Frequently Asked Questions

#### Are you collecting all my data?

No. All of Matt's Maths Problems runs in your browser, so nothing should leave your computer.

If that's wrong please let us know right away because something has gone very very bad.

#### Do you know if I get a question wrong?

I can't tell if you got a question wrong, but if I could I would tell you that I'm proud of you for trying! The more you practice and the more you try the more you learn.
