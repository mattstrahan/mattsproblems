### Stuff that we use

If I'm going to be honest, Matt's Maths Problems uses far more stuff that Matt didn't write than stuff that Matt did write. If I were to instead call it "Matt and React and Mozilla and Unified and Khan Academy and all the other's Maths Problems" then the name would be far more accurate.

Unfortunately that would be a really long name, so instead I just took full credit and named it after myself.

Matt's Maths Problems wouldn't be possible without these projects (and more):

- React: It allows all this to run in your web browser.
- Cloudflare and Github: They host this all for free which is pretty great.
- Mozilla Nunjucks: With Nunjucks we can make questions and answers which is really helpful for writing problems.
- MUI: Without MUI the app would look like a toaster. MUI makes it look like a really really fancy and responsive toaster.
- Khan Academy's Katex: A maths equation needs to look cool, and Katex makes it look cool.
- Unified, React Markdown, Rehype, Remark, and a whole bunch of React plugins allow us to make questions with headings and bold and all that formatting.
