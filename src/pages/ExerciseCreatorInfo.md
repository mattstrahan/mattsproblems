Welcome to the exercise creator. Here you can build your very own exercises for people to do.

This page allows you to choose variables, write questions, and write answers. To do that you need to know how to use curly braces (like `{{a+b}}`), write Latex equations, and write Markdown formatted text. If you're going "what are you talking about with all this?" you should [read the documentation here](https://github.com/mattstrahan/mattsproblems/wiki/Building-exercises).
